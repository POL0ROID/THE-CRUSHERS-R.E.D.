# THE-CRUSHERS-R.E.D.
Database program and vote interface for administering ranked-choice elections.

Ranked Choice Election Database v0.9.9.9
by THE CRUSHERS (Emma Yanoviak and team leader William Baker "Polo Sepulveda")

The program should run upon being launched from Eclipse or a JAR (from the console). From there, follow the instructions, input the requested data, and the Vote view will appear. The rest is intuitive.

Known (significant) bugs:

- The round 2+ algorithm does not function due to loss of time: This does not concern me very much, as the assignment is about the user end, and the tabulation is more of an administrative thing. Instead, the administrator can use the console output, and tabulate it manually.

- The UML diagram included is flawed and outdated, but still conveys the basic concept to a degree.
